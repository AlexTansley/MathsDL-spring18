-- Introduction: the Curse of Dimensionality. 


-- Part I: Geometry of Data
--- Euclidean Geometry: transportation metrics, CNNs , scattering. [2 lectures]
--- Non-Euclidean Geometry: Hausdorff-Gromov distances, Graph Neural Networks. [1 lecture]
--- Unsupervised Learning under Geometric Priors (Implicit vs explicit models, microcanonical vs transportation metrics). [1 lecture]
--- Applications: adversarial examples, graph inference, inverse problems. [1 lecture]
--- Notorious Papers: adversarial training/examples, attention mechanisms (explained now as graph neural nets), graph inference and message passing.

-- Part II: Geometry of Optimization and Generalization
--- Stochastic Optimization (Robbins & Munro, Convergence of SGD) [1.5 lecture]
--- Stochastic Differential Equations (Fokker-Plank, Gradient Flow, Langevin Dynamics, links with SGD; open problems) [1.5 lecture]
--- Information Geometry (Amari, Fisher-Rao metric, Wasserstein) [0.5 lecture]
--- Landscape of Deep Learning Optimization (Tensor/Matrix factorization, Deep Nets; open problems). [1.5 lecture]
Generalization: (Recap on Rademacher Complexity, Entropy Bounds, Covering Numbers; measuring capacity in CNNs; open problems). [2 lectures]
