## Syllabus

This Graduate-level topics course aims at offering a glimpse into the emerging mathematical questions around Deep Learning. In particular, we will focus on the different geometrical aspects surounding these models, from input geometric stability priors to the geometry of optimization, generalisation and learning. We will cover both the background and the current open problems. 

Besides the lectures, we will also run a parallel curricula (optional), which, starting from a landmark recent DL paper (AlphaGo), will trace back the fundamentals of Dynammic Programming, Policy Learning and Monte-Carlo Tree Search through the literature and lab materials. 

## Pre-requisites

Multivariate Calculus, Linear Algebra, Probability and Statistics at solid undergraduate level.

Notions of Harmonic Analysis, Differential Geometry and Stochastic Calculus are nice-to-have, but not essential.

## Grading

The course will be graded with a final research project plus a participation grade. 
Details TBA.
